<h1>My ideas</h1>
<h2>Here are some tech things i have thought of.</h2>
<h3>Hy-Ring</h3>
<p>The Hy-Ring will be a smart ring that will have a projecter type thing like on the cicret braclet
like this <img src="http://cdn.mos.techradar.com/art/features/Cicret%20Bracelet-970-80.jpg">
so it will be on your finger and project, steps or calories on to your finger like the cicret braclet on to your 
arm. It will be hopefully be made out of graphene so it will be quit felxible so comfortable, and strong. Also the outside will be a mixture or carbon and 
graphene because it will look quite cool. Becaus ethis is what carbon fibre looks like.

<h3>
Smart Handle Bar
</h3>
<p>
The smart handle bar is some tihing alse i thought of for bikes with can moniter yo rides without having to be activated because it will be the grip part and if 
pressure goes on it for a minuet it will active a ride and it has indbuild small accelrometer and gps
to track your ride and how fast you are going. This would be better than some fitness baand aswell because it
will not be uncomfortable and it will feel like you are riding normaly.
