<p>
I find this phone very nice because the curved <br>screen makes for a good design.<br>
Also the water proof is helpful because i<br> imagine the screen my be a bit slipery to start<br> with so you way drop it in the bath<br> a few times and it wont brake.
<br><strong><m>Also some specs about this phone</m></strong><i>Ram:4gb <br>/ camera:12mp(back),5mp(front) </i>

<p>
The iphone 6s has been prived on its 3d <br> touch but personally i think <br>that its not really that good<br> a thing because it is the same as<br> if you hold for longer on sometihing that happens.
